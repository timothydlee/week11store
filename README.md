Creating Store Inventory App able to Interact with Customer and Manager while Maintaining Database 

App leverages MySQL database, node.js, and Javascript.

bamazonCustomer allows the customer to see a display of items available for purchase. Then the customer can purchase any item up to the maximum amount that exists in inventory. Items that have 0 inventory will not be displayed until the manager orders restocking of the item. 

bamazonManager allows the manager to see a display of all the items and their inventory, see a specific table that displays only low and out of stock inventory, and allows the manager to order more stock of existing inventory while also allowing the manager to add new items into the inventory log as well.

I uploaded videos demonstrating the app to YouTube.
